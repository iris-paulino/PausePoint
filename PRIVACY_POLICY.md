## Permissions

• **Foreground Service**: Used to maintain persistent monitoring and data synchronization
• **Internet Access**: Used to display advertisements through Google AdMob

## Accessibility Service Usage

ScrollPause uses Android's Accessibility Service API to provide enhanced digital wellbeing features. This service is used exclusively for legitimate digital wellness purposes and complies with Google Play Store policies.

**What the Accessibility Service Does:**
• **App Usage Monitoring**: Detects which apps you're currently using to track your digital habits
• **Time Limit Enforcement**: Redirects you to our app's pause screen when you reach your set time limits for specific apps
• **App Redirection**: Redirects you to our app when time limits are reached, allowing you to take a mindful break
• **Digital Wellbeing Support**: Helps you maintain healthy digital habits and reduce screen time

**What the Accessibility Service Does NOT Do:**
• **No Content Access**: Does not read, access, or transmit any content from your apps
• **No Personal Data Collection**: Only monitors app names and usage times, not personal information
• **No System Control**: Does not control or modify system settings beyond app redirection
• **No Data Transmission**: All monitoring data stays on your device

**User Control:**
• You can disable the Accessibility Service at any time through Android Settings > Accessibility Services
• Disabling the service will stop app redirection but standard tracking will continue
• You can re-enable the service anytime through the app's settings
• The service only activates when you explicitly grant permission through our consent dialog

**Privacy Protection:**
• All app usage data is stored locally on your device
• No personal information is collected or transmitted
• The service only monitors app names, not app content or personal data
• You have full control over when and how the service operates

## Background Services and Data Persistence

• **Foreground Service**: Our app runs a foreground service to maintain monitoring capabilities even when the main app is not actively visible. This service:
  - Displays a persistent notification indicating monitoring is active
  - Saves tracking data every 30 seconds to prevent data loss
  - Can be terminated by the user through Android settings
  - Uses minimal battery and system resources

• **App Restart Detection**: The app automatically detects when it has been restarted and can resume tracking if it was previously active. This feature:
  - Saves your current tracking state before the app is terminated
  - Automatically restores tracking settings when the app restarts
  - Only activates if tracking was previously enabled
  - Can be disabled by stopping tracking before closing the app

• **Data Persistence**: To ensure your tracking data is not lost:
  - App usage data is saved locally every 30 seconds during active tracking
  - Tracking state is preserved across app restarts
  - All data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers

## Advertising and Third-Party Services

• We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in our app
• AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad targeting
• This data is shared with Google and advertising partners
• You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings
• AdMob's privacy policy applies to advertising data collection

## Your Rights and Controls

• **Access your data**: View all data stored in the app through the app's interface
• **Delete your data**: Remove all data by uninstalling the app or clearing app data
• **Control services**: Disable the foreground service, accessibility service, or usage access through Android settings

• **User Consent**: All data collection and monitoring features require explicit user consent through our detailed consent dialog

• **No Deceptive Behavior**: Our app does not mimic system notifications or engage in deceptive practices
• **Digital Wellbeing Focus**: Our app is designed as a digital wellbeing tool to help users manage their screen time and app usage
